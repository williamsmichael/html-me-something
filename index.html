                    <p>My name is Michael Williams. Moved to Pacific Northwest from the Midwest. Studied in university and proceeded to build a career in a fast, data-driven environment working on fascinating problems that make a difference. In my free time, I enjoy hanging out with the family, hiking &amp exploring the local area, and lots of coding.</p>
