                    <p>My name is Michael Williams. Moved to Pacific Northwest from the Midwest. Studied in university and proceeded to build a career in a fast, data-driven environment working on fascinating problems that make a difference. I enjoy spending time with the family, hiking &amp exploring, and lots of coding.</p>
